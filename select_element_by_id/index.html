        by using id, if you want to select only one element-->
        <li>list 3</li>
    </ul>
    <script >
        let elm = document.getElementById('first')// here the elm variable storing that <li id="first">list 2</li>
        //console.log(elm);// if we will choose that id which does not exist then it will give us null
        // elm stores that ele as object so we can apply properties and method on that as well
        console.log(elm.innerHTML);// it stores 'list 1' text
        // it is the method is getting value


        // now we will set the value and for this we will do this
        elm.innerHTML = "<p> hello </p>";
